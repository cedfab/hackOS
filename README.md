# hackOS [hackOS](https://i.postimg.cc/3NV97nvh/temp-Imagef3m-Wkd.avif)
hackOS is a Ubuntu derivative that is **right about to release** for x86.
It is made for replacing a hackintosh, as macOS 26 is the last one to support intel.

## Compatibility
For compatibility - it is gonna have [Darling](https://www.darlinghq.org/) for you to use a few macOS apps.

## Looks
For looks, it uses the basic dash-to-dock extension for gnome and a few tweaks.

## Release
It is planned to release before **24th October** as it is currently in development.

## Future of the project
hackOS will be updated *probably: if the project won't fail* and i will try to develop my own software for it.
